P2 Coding Assignment - Paris Metro: Exploring the Paris Metro Subway Network

There was no code given in this assignment

Implemented Features:

- Task 2 i) Finding all the stations on the same line (sameLine function)
- Task 2 ii) Finding the shortest path between two stations (shortestPath function)
- Task 2 iii) Finding the shortest path between two stations when there is a broken line (shortestPathWithBrokenLine function)
- Bonus Task was not implemented

Running the Program:

The program must be run from command line with the following command structure: java ParisMetro N1 N2 N3

N1, N2, and N3 are integer values for the subway stations 

- If only N1 is run in the command, then the sameLine function is run and all the stations on the same line as N1 will be printed

- If N1 and N2 are run in the command, the shortestPath function is run and the shortest path from N1 to N2 will be printed

- If N1, N2, and N3 are run in the command, the shortestPathWithBrokenLine function is run and the shortest path from N1 to N2 is printed, avoiding any stations on the same line as N3.

There are no known bugs within the code and all outputs have been tested to work properly.
